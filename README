My version of the Ascensor plugin. It works ie7 plus and builds the menu on top dinamically. It also resize to fit the screen, even on resize.
Demo over at: http://zhereicome.com/experiments/statics/myascensor

It supports swipes on iDevices and you can link to a particular slide in the url.


Co-coded with https://github.com/Oeg87
